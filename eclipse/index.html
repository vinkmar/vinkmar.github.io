<h1>2024 Eclipse Adventure</h1>
<h3>Vince Marcovecchio</h3>


<h2>Introduction</h2>
<div class="text">
    At some point in January, as Tamera and I were talking about it, the upcoming total solar eclipse rapidly transformed from a mildly interesting event to a hyperfixation for us. Although neither of us had ever witnessed a total solar eclipse before, and &mdash; with one brief exception during a meteor shower &mdash; neither of us had tried astrophotography before, the path of totality was only a couple of hours away from our home in Ottawa. So we decided that photographing the eclipse was a worthwhile adventure.
</div>
<div class="text">
    This post is my brief attempt at documenting our experience and showing off some of the photos that we shot. 
</div>


<h2>Planning</h2>
<div class="images">
    <a href="kingston.jpg"><img src="kingston.jpg" style="width: 800px;" /></a>
</div>
<div class="text">
    After a couple of evenings' worth of googling, we picked Kingston as our viewing destination: it was in the path of totality, only a couple of hours from home, accessible without a car, didn't look like it'd be too busy, had nearby alternate viewing sites we could get to easily, and was a big enough city for us to maintain our Covid precautions (i.e., it had many food delivery and outdoor patio options). By early February, we booked everything we needed to and were committed to the trip. (Good thing, too, since I've been told there was quite a run on solar filters and telephoto lens rentals by April.)
</div>


<h2>Gear</h2>
<div class="text">
    We wanted to capture as much of the eclipse as possible without bankrupting ourselves by buying lots of new gear. Based on what we already had, we ended up with a three-camera digital setup. 
</div>
<div class="text">
    I don't think I've ever packed this much photo gear for a trip before:
</div>
<div class="images">
    <a href="gear.jpg"><img src="gear.jpg" style="width: 800px;" /></a>
</div>
<div class="text">
    Nor have I been <em>this</em> exhaustive with my packing lists (which are usually pretty detailed to begin with):
</div>
<div class="images">
    <a href="packinglist.jpg"><img src="packinglist.jpg" style="width: 800px;" /></a>
</div>
<div class="text">
    Our primary camera was a Nikon D600 with a Nikon AF-S Nikkor 200-500 f/5.6E lens and a Nisi UV/IR Cut ND100000 solar filter. This was mounted on a Peak Design aluminum travel tripod. I used this for traditional eclipse shots. 
</div>
<div class="text">
    Our secondary camera was a Fujifilm X100T with no filter. Tamera used this to get crowd and peripheral shots.
</div>
<div class="text">
    Our tertiary camera was an Aukey AC-LC2 action camera with no filter. We set this up to capture a wide-angle timelapse of us, the eclipse, and the environment around us. 
</div>
<div class="text">
    I MacGyvered all the cameras to run off of several massive USB power banks, so we didn't need to worry about switching out any batteries midway through the eclipse. I also &mdash; with the assistance of lots of gaffer tape and a tripod clamp &mdash; repurposed an old 7" HDMI display to serve as a more ergonomic live view screen for our primary camera. 
</div>
<div class="text">
    Oh, and naturally, I did make <a href="https://vkm.ca/eclipse18/">a small web app</a> for tracking and counting down to the exact contact times for the eclipse using USNO data: 
</div>
<div class="images">
    <a href="webapp.png"><img src="webapp.png" style="width: 200px;" /></a>
</div>
<div class="text">
    (Three days before the eclipse, that web app got <a href="https://vkm.ca/eclipse18/banglejs/eclipse.app.js">ported to my Bangle.js 2 smartwatch</a> when it dawned on me that it'd be much easier to glance at my watch than at my phone during the eclipse. Although functional, the port is pretty ugly, and it'll eat through the watch's battery in under ten hours.)
</div>
<h2>Madness</h2>
<div class="text">
    The last time I was in Kingston was over a decade ago. When we arrived on the 7th, it was... definitely different. Tourism Kingston was marketing the hell out of the eclipse (and may have <a href="https://www.thewhig.com/news/solar-eclipse-crowds-smaller-than-expected-in-kingston">landed themselves in hot water anticipating ridiculous visitor numbers</a>), and public transit was going to be free during eclipse day:

</div>
<div class="text">
    Local businesses were taking advantage of the opportunity to have themed sales over the weekend, explore new markets by selling eclipse glasses, and/or close early on eclipse day:

<h2>Clouds</h2>
<div class="text">
    I have never been as obsessed with cloud forecasts as I was the first week of April. Randall Munroe was very on point in <a href="https://xkcd.com/2915/">this recent xkcd</a>: 
</div>
<div class="images">
    <a href="https://xkcd.com/2915/"><img src="clouds-xkcd.png" style="border: 5px solid white;"/></a>
</div>
<div class="text">
    While our primary viewing site was Battery Park in Kingston, we planned (and booked train tickets) for three alternate viewing sites (Belleville, Brockville, and Cornwall) all within a couple of hours of our hotel, and had a 10 AM deadline on eclipse day to make a final decision. 
</div>
<div class="text">
    Needless to say, there were many frantic group chats with photographer friends in the hours leading up to that deadline, and constant refreshing of the set of <a href="links.html">weather links I had put together</a>. Unfortunately, the cloud forecasts for all four sites looked like relative degrees of shit for the duration of the eclipse (dark blue = clear sky; white = cloud): 
</div>
<div class="images">
    <a href="clouds2.png"><img src="clouds2.png" style="width: 200px;" /></a>
    <a href="clouds1.png"><img src="clouds1.png" style="width: 200px;" /></a>

    <a href="clouds4.png"><img src="clouds4.png" style="width: 200px;" /></a>
</div>
<div class="text">
    At 8:13 AM, we decided to stick with our primary viewing site (which also meant we had a few extra hours to go antique shopping). 
</div>

<h2>Eclipse</h2>
<div class="text">
    We arrived at Battery Park just after 1:30 PM and got comfortable pretty quickly: 
</div>
<div class="images">
    <a href="setup.jpg"><img src="setup.jpg" style="width: 800px;" /></a>
</div>
<div class="text">
    The crowd in the park topped out at probably about 100 or 200 people, several with cameras or telescopes. 
</div>
<div class="images">
    <a href="crowd.jpg"><img src="crowd.jpg" style="width: 800px;" /></a>
</div>
<div class="text">
    Unfortunately, cloud cover was pretty thick, so I couldn't even get a manual focus lock on the sun until a break happened a few minutes into the partial eclipse. But then the fun started, and the variable cloud cover gave the sun some interesting texture (even if that did mean fiddling with my exposure settings constantly): 
</div>
<div class="images">
    <a href="eclipse-clouds.jpg"><img src="eclipse-clouds.jpg" style="width: 400px;" /></a>
    <a href="eclipse-noclouds.jpg"><img src="eclipse-noclouds.jpg" style="width: 400px;" /></a>
</div>
<div class="text">
    At 3:01 PM, I realized that I miiiiiight have had my camera set up in a spot where my view of totality could be blocked by a building, so I quickly relocated a few meters away for the most exciting part of the countdown (which also meant Tamera could get awesome photos of me taking photos):
</div>
<div class="images">
    <a href="totality-countdown1.jpg"><img src="totality-countdown1.jpg" style="width: 400px;" /></a>
    <a href="totality-countdown2.jpg"><img src="totality-countdown2.jpg" style="width: 400px;" /></a>
</div>
<div class="text">
    And then, totality: 
</div>
<div class="images">
    <a href="totality.gif"><img src="totality.gif" style="width: 400px;" /></a>
</div>
<div class="text">
    Or, as seen through our primary camera (with some minor haziness due to the clouds):
</div>
<div class="images">
    <a href="totality.jpg"><img src="totality.jpg" style="width: 800px;" /></a>
</div>
<div class="text">
    Of course, about three and a half extremely short minutes later, the sun came back (and these are perhaps my favourite photos from the eclipse):
</div>
<div class="images">
    <a href="totality-end1.jpg"><img src="totality-end1.jpg" style="width: 400px;" /></a>
    <a href="totality-end2.jpg"><img src="totality-end2.jpg" style="width: 400px;" /></a>
</div>
<div class="text">
    We didn't actually stay for the rest of the partial eclipse after that. Thicker clouds had started rolling in, and the last photo on our primary camera (with a timestamp of 3:51 PM) is an unfortunately hazy blob.
</div>


<h2>Periphery</h2>
<div class="text">
    Naturally, our trip to Kingston wasn't <em>only</em> for the eclipse (even if our luggage suggested otherwise). We did get up to some of our more typical travel activities:
</div>
<div class="text">
    We splurged and stayed at The Smith Hotel, a renovated old church with absolutely marvellous art deco styling. 
</div>
<div class="text">
    We visited Antique Alley and crated away a dangerous amount of uranium glass. 
</div>
<div class="text">
    We brought home a standard book pile thanks to our browsing at Novel Idea, Berry &amp; Peterson Booksellers, and Value Village (hey, Tamera found some awesome signed &amp; numbered editions from Subterranean Press there). 
</div>
<div class="text">
    And we spent an inordinate amount of time sitting on cafe and restaurant patios. 
</div>


<h2>Outlook</h2>
<div class="text">
    Are we about to join the ranks eclipse chasers worldwide? I'm not entirely sure. Those moments of totality were absolutely incredible and stunning. The prospect of another minute of totality in Iceland in 2026, or of over six minutes of totality in Egypt in 2027 is awfully tempting, even if we don't tend to like travelling <em>that</em> much. Of course, if we did try to see one of those eclipses, I'd need to get started on upgrading my camera gear now :P
